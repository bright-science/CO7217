* :computer: [Exercises with Groovy](./Groovy_exercises/readme.md)
  * :computer: [solution](./Groovy_exercises_solution/) (this link will be enabled when the solution is released)
* :computer: [Gradle Exercise 1](./Gradle_ex01/readme.md): Gradle tasks and dependencies
  * :computer: [solution](./Gradle_ex01_solution/) (this link will be enabled when the solution is released)
* :computer: [Gradle Exercise 2](./Gradle_ex02/readme.md): Java builds and Java libraries
  * :computer: [solution](./Gradle_ex02_solution/) (this link will be enabled when the solution is released)

Solutions to exercises will be posted under this folder on GitHub as projects with the name `${ExerciseName}_solution`.
